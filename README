----------------------------------
Description
----------------------------------
A lightweight tool for templating Json in Scala


----------------------------------
Usage
----------------------------------

Best explained by example and by looking at tests.

Example:

val obj = jsonObject() {
      field("Store", Some("Bob's Fromagery"))
      jsonObject("Address") {
        field("Suite", Some("1"))
        field("Number", Some("21b"))
        field("Name", Some("Baker Street"))
      }
      jsonArray("Cheeses") {
        value(Some("Munster"))
        value(Some("Brie"))
        value(Some("Cheddar"))
      }
    }
    
println(obj.asString)


Result:

{"Store":"Bob's Fromagery","Address":{"Suite":"1","Number":"21b","Name":"Baker Street"},"Cheeses":["Munster","Brie","Cheddar"]}

Changes:

Version 0.3 -

Now runs with Scala 2.8

Version 0.5.x -

- Made it thread safe
- Now escaping of linefeed type characters
- Chose collections that are common between 2.7 and 2.8
- Added a build.xml.  To build, you will need to include the appropriate scala-compiler.jar and scala-library.jar and amend the classpath in the ant file accordingly.
- Fixed bug with null array values being treated as "null" strings
